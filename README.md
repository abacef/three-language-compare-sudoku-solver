# three-language-compare-sudoku-solver

This project will directly help me understand speed differences between the 
programing languages Java, C and Python. Each language is used to implement a 
sudoku solving algorithm based on the same psudocode. indicated in the file 
psudocode.txt

All aspects of development are happening on the terminal. Since I learned how to
use many unix commands and was forced to use vi in my recent Mechanics of 
Programing class, and learned to properly use github's integration with git in
my recent Introduction to Software Engineering class, I will merge those two 
ideas (since it is faster anyway).
